This plugin gives you a wide range of modifications at hand <strong>without any core or theme code changes</strong> - making them persistent across updates or switching to another theme.</p><p>th23 Specials core features include (all available as options in admin dashboard):</p><ul><li>Mail sending via <strong>SMTP server</strong> instead of default PHP mail function - and with custom subject prefix</li><li><strong>Revision and edit restrictions</strong> for posts and pages</li><li><strong>Highlighting in titles</strong> of posts and pages - for custom styling via theme</li><li><strong>Category selection</strong> via radio button, forcing single category assignment and option to restrict available categories - via Classic and Gutenberg / Block editor</li><li><strong>Excerpts</strong> for pages</li><li><strong>Sticky posts</strong> also sticky on archive pages</li><li>Disabling <strong>author links and archives</strong></li><li>Enforcing usage of <strong>more tag / block / separator</strong> in posts and pages - preventing too long full text display on home and overview pages</li><li>Disable various <strong>headers</strong> - core version info, links, jQuery Migrate, inline CSS, emojis, oEmbed, legacy contact options</li></ul><h3>Usage</h3><p>Simply install plugin and choose customizations required from the plugin settings page. Few options involve further actions to achieve required result - <strong>see below and FAQ section</strong> for more details.</p><p>For <strong>highlighting in post / page titles</strong>, put part to highlight in between <code>*matching stars*</code> in the editor. This part will be enclosed by <code><span></span></code> tags in the HTML on the frontend, allowing styling by theme via the CSS selector <code>.entry-title span</code>.</p><blockquote style=\"padding: 0 0.5em; border-left: 5px solid rgb(9, 105, 218);\"><div style=\"color: rgb(9, 105, 218);\">&#128488;&#65039; <strong>NOTE</strong></div><p>Some options change important core functionality of Wordpress - make sure you <strong>properly test your website</strong> before usage in production environment!</p></blockquote>",
        "installation": "<p>For a manual installation upload extracted <code>th23-specials</code> folder to your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</p><p>The plugin is <strong>configured via its settings page in the admin area</strong>. Find all options under <code>Settings</code> &#8594; <code>th23 Specials</code>. The options come with a description of the setting and its behavior directly next to the respective settings field.</p>",
        "faq": "<h4>Is there a way to identify <strong>existing posts / pages that do not comply</strong> with the one category only requirement or that are missing the \"read more\" block / tag?</h4><div><p>Yes, there are links in the descriptions on the th23 Specials settings page, <strong>next to the respective option</strong> to search for \"non-compliant\" posts / pages.</p><p>Upon a click on this link you will see all currently non-compliant posts / pages. You can modify these by clicking on their titles, which loads them into your default editor.</p></div><h4>Some <strong>settings seem to have no effect</strong> - eg oEmbed features are still active depsite deactivated?</h4><div><p>This might be happening as <strong>some options can be \"overruled\"</strong> by settings by your theme. For settings that might be affected, please see the description on the settings page.</p><p>To change such settings, please <strong>check your active theme</strong> and adjust them there, if required.</p></div>",
