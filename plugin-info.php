Setting up new websites from time to time I realized, that I keep using **similar sets of modifications over and over again**. This plugin gives you a wide range of modifications at hand **without any core or theme code changes** - making them persistent across updates or switching to another theme.

th23 Specials core features include (all available as options in admin dashboard):

* Mail sending via **SMTP server** instead of default PHP mail function - and with custom subject prefix
* **Revision and edit restrictions** for posts and pages
* **Highlighting in titles** of posts and pages - for custom styling via theme
* **Category selection** via radio button, forcing single category assignment and option to restrict available categories - via Classic and Gutenberg / Block editor
* **Excerpts** for pages
* **Sticky posts** also sticky on archive pages
* Disabling **author links and archives**
* Enforcing usage of **more tag / block / separator** in posts and pages - preventing too long full text display on home and overview pages
* Disable various **headers** - core version info, links, jQuery Migrate, inline CSS, emojis, oEmbed, legacy contact options';

For **highlighting in post / page titles**, put part to highlight in between `*matching stars*` in the editor. This part will be enclosed by `<span></span>` tags in the HTML on the frontend, allowing styling by theme via the CSS selector `.entry-title span`.
