Essentials to customize Wordpress via simple settings, SMTP, title highlight, category selection, more separator, sticky posts, remove clutter, ...


## üöÄ Introduction

Customize your Wordpress website even more to your needs via **simple admin settings** instead of code modifications.

Setting up new websites from time to time I realized, that I keep using **similar sets of modifications over and over again**. This plugin gives you a wide range of modifications at hand **without any core or theme code changes** - making them persistent across updates or switching to another theme.

th23 Specials core features include (all available as options in admin dashboard):

* Mail sending via **SMTP server** instead of default PHP mail function - and with custom subject prefix
* **Revision and edit restrictions** for posts and pages
* **Highlighting in titles** of posts and pages - for custom styling via theme
* **Category selection** via radio button, forcing single category assignment and option to restrict available categories - via Classic and Gutenberg / Block editor
* **Excerpts** for pages
* **Sticky posts** also sticky on archive pages
* Disabling **author links and archives**
* Enforcing usage of **more tag / block / separator** in posts and pages - preventing too long full text display on home and overview pages
* Disable various **headers** - core version info, links, jQuery Migrate, inline CSS, emojis, oEmbed, legacy contact options

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

For a manual installation upload extracted `th23-specials` folder to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.

The plugin is **configured via its settings page in the admin area**. Find all options under `Settings` -> `th23 Specials`. The options come with a description of the setting and its behavior directly next to the respective settings field.


## üñêÔ∏è Usage

Simply install plugin and choose customizations required from the plugin settings page. Few options involve further actions to achieve required result - **see below and FAQ section** for more details.

For **highlighting in post / page titles**, put part to highlight in between `*matching stars*` in the editor. This part will be enclosed by `<span></span>` tags in the HTML on the frontend, allowing styling by theme via the CSS selector `.entry-title span`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some options change important core functionality of Wordpress - make sure you **properly test your website** before usage in production environment!


## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Is there a way to identify **existing posts / pages that do not comply** with the one category only requirement or that are missing the "read more" block / tag? ###

A: Yes, there are links in the descriptions on the th23 Specials settings page, **next to the respective option** to search for "non-compliant" posts / pages.

Upon a click on this link you will see all currently non-compliant posts / pages. You can modify these by clicking on their titles, which loads them into your default editor.

### Q: Some **settings seem to have no effect** - eg oEmbed features are still active depsite deactivated? ###

A: This might be happening as **some options can be "overruled"** by settings by your theme. For settings that might be affected, please see the description on the settings page.

To change such settings, please **check your active theme** and adjust them there, if required.
